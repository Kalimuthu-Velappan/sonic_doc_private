# About this Manual
Platform Driver Development Framework (PDDF) is part of SONiC Platform Development Kit (PDK) which optimizes the platform development. PDK consists of 
 - PDDF (Platform Driver Development Framework): For optimized data-driven platform driver and SONiC device-object class development
 - PDE (Platform Development Environment): For optimized build and test of platform and SAI code

PDE details are covered in another document. This document describes Platform Driver Development Framework (PDDF) which can be used as an alternative to the existing manually-written SONiC platform driver framework. It enables platform vendors to rapidly develop the device specific custom drivers and SONiC user space python device-object classes, using a data-driven architecture, to manage platform devices like Fan, PSUs, LEDs, Optics, System EEPROM, etc., and validate a platform on SONiC. 

# Scope
This document describes the high level design details of PDDF and its components. The PDDF consists of generic device drivers and user space platform object classes which use the per platform specific data in the JSON descriptor files. This document describes the interaction between all the components and the tools used to support these drivers and object classes.

## 1 Requirements Overview
SONiC OS is portable across different network devices with supported ASIC via Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI). These devices primarily differ in the way various device specific hardware components are accessed, and thus require custom device drivers and python object classes. Each platform vendor implements these custom device drivers and object classes. The feature requirement is to support a SONiC platform driver development framework to enable rapid development of custom device drivers and classes.

## 2 Functional Description

SONiC platform bring up typically involves the following steps:

 - Support Switching ASIC
 - Vendor platform specific drivers and device-object classes to manage platform devices

Generally, the SAI support for a given switching silicon is pre-validated, and the platform vendor mostly focuses on the platform devices during platform bring up. The platform components involve the following:

 - port_config.ini (Port / Lane mappings)
 - config.bcm
 - Platform Device drivers (FAN/PSU/Optics/Sensors/CPLD,etc.)
 - SONiC platform python object classes

Most of the platform bring up effort goes in developing the platform device drivers, SONiC object classes and validating them. Typically each platform vendor writes their own drivers and classes which is very tailor made to that platform. This involves writing code, building, installing it on the target platform devices and testing. Many of the details of the platform are hard coded into these drivers, from the HW spec. They go through this cycle repetitively till everything works fine, and is validated before upstreaming the code.

PDDF aims to make this platform driver and device-object class development process much simpler by providing a data driven development framework. This is enabled by:

 - JSON descriptor files for platform data
 - Generic data-driven drivers for various devices
 - Generic SONiC device-object classes
 - Vendor specific extensions for customization and extensibility

This makes the development and testing much simpler. Any change in the platform data can be made on the target in the JSON files and validated instantly. This helps improve the productivity of the platform developers significantly.

## 3 Design

### 3.1 Overview

![PDDF Architecture](images/pddf_hld1_2.0.png)

 SONiC PDDF (Platform driver development framework) supports the following HW devices on a given platform: 
 
 - Fan
 - PSU
 - System EEPROM
 - CPLD
 - Optic Transceivers
 - System LED control via CPLD 
 - System Status Registers in CPLD
 - Temp Sensors 
 
 High level architecture of the PDDF consists of the following:

 - PDDF JSON Descriptor files  
 - Generic PDDF Python object classes for various devices implementing the Platform APIs
 - PDDF Tools
 - Generic PDDF HW device drivers in kernel space
 - Custom vendor driver extensions modules

#### 3.1.1	JSON Descriptor files

 The descriptor files are used to represent the following information for a given platform: 	
 - I2C Topology descriptor
	 - Representation of the I2C bus
   - I2C client devices
   - Inter connection of I2C devices	 	
 - I2C Device Access attributes 		
	 - Each device exposes a set of data attributes to read/write  		
		 - Eg., PSU(psu_present), SFP/QSFP(sfp_present, lpmode) - CPLD registers/offsets/ masks, etc., 		
	 - For each device, platform specific attributes to help access the data attributes 		
 -  Reference to a standard Linux driver, if available and used, for I2C device
	 - pca954x,   lm75, etc., 	
 - Value Map for each device in a platform 		
	 - Each  device or a platform can represent values to be interpreted in a different way.
		 - For eg., on some platforms “1” can represent “Port Side Intake”, whereas on another platform it could be “0”. This map provides how to interpret the values.

#### 3.1.2 Generic PDDF HW Device Drivers


PDDF generic drivers are device drivers for the following devices: FAN/PSU/EEPROM/Optics Transceivers/ System LED/ CPLDs. These drivers in kernel space, rely on the per-platform data in JSON descriptor files to expose data via SysFS interface. They provide a generic interface to get/set of these attributes. There are two types of data, a driver works on:

 - Device data – Attributes exposed by the device itself
 - Platform access data – Information on how/ where to access the device attributes

These generic PDDF drivers provide capabilities to:

 - Extend using vendor implementations
 - Mix and match generic and standard drivers
 - Support any existing driver for a given component

#### 3.1.3 PDDF Platform Device Object Classes
PDDF provides generic user space python object classes which implement the platform APIs defined under:
 - src/sonic-platform-common/sonic_platform_base/sfp_base.py (Optic transceivers)
 - src/sonic-platform-common/sonic_platform_base/psu_base.py (PSU base class)
 - src/sonic-platform-common/sonic_platform_base/fan_base.py (FAN base class)
 - src/sonic-platform-common/sonic_platform_base/thermal_base.py (Thermal sensor base class)
 - src/sonic-platform-common/sonic_platform_base/platform_base.py (Platform base class)
 - src/sonic-platform-common/sonic_platform_base/chassis_base.py (Chassis base class)
 - src/sonic-platform-common/sonic_platform_base/watchdog_base.py (Watchdog base class)

These device-object classes use the per platform JSON descriptor files to use the appropriate SysFS attributes to get and set.

#### 3.1.4 Source code organization and Packaging
PDDF source code is mainly organized into platform dependent data files(JSON descriptors), generic PDDF  driver modules, generic  device-object classes, generic utils, and start up scripts.

 - /service/sonic-buildimage/platform/pddf
	  - modules
	  - scripts

 - /service/sonic-buildimage/device/common/pddf
	  - sonic_platform (2.0 Platform device-object classes)
	  - plugins (1.0 platform plugins)
	  
 - JSON descriptor files should be placed in the "pddf/json" directory under the respective "/sonic-buildimage/platform/" directory path. For example:
	 - sonic-buildimage/platform/broadcom/sonic-platform-modules-accton/as7712-32x/pddf/json/\<descriptor.json\>)

From SONiC build, all the PDDF components shall be built and packaged into a common pddf Debian package. Every platform builds and packages per platform specific drivers, utilities, scripts, etc.,  into a platform Debian package. 

#### 3.1.5 Deployment details
For the Runtime environment, PDDF shall provide a init script which shall be integrated into the per platform init script. This will load the PDDF modules and device-object classes and will use the per platform JSON descriptor files for initializing the platform service. 

### 3.2 Generic Driver Design
Vendors write platform specific component drivers and deploy them as kernel loadable modules. In PDDF, drivers are generic, with platform specific data populated in JSON descriptor files. The JSON descriptor files are provided by the PDDF developer. Usually two different kernel modules are associated with each component. One is *Device Driver Module* and other is *Device Module*.

For a generic device driver, there are 2 types of data.
 - Device-Data Attributes
 - Access-Data

**Device-Data Attributes:**
	These are the attributes exposed to the user by the driver. These attributes provide device-related information. These attributes can be read-only or read-write. These attributes are dynamically associated with the device driver using the input from data JSON file. Examples of Device-Data attributes include,
	*psu_present* and *psu_power_good* for PSU, and
	*fan1_presence* and *fan1_input* for FAN device drivers.

**Access-Data:**
	This is platform specific data used to retrieve values from hardware. This includes per-Device Data attribute device addresses, register offsets, masks, expected values and length. This access-data varies for various components. The per-platform data is read from JSON file and passed to the kernel space as driver platform_data using the access-data attributes.


#### 3.2.1 PDDF Device Driver Modules
PDDF device driver modules are generic. Access-Data is attached to the I2C device data structure during I2C device instantiation. This access-data also specifies which Device-Data attributes are supported, along with the platform dependent data for each attribute. The supported Device-Data attributes are dynamically created as SysFS attributes. This design is helpful in linking different Device-Data attributes to different I2C client devices, if applicable. The additional *driver_data* for the client, which consist of values of the attributes, last updated time, mutex lock, name etc, is also allocated dynamically and maintained *per-attribute* wise.

![Figure1: PSU device driver](images/pddf_device_driver_psu.png "PSU Device Driver")


#### 3.2.2 PDDF Device Modules
PDDF device module is an intermediate module to manage the actual device driver module. It helps populate the per-platform access data, and manages the access data attributes via SysFS interface. It also helps in I2C device instantiation using the I2C topology data and access-data. It defines a SysFs attribute *dev_ops* to trigger instantiation or detachment of the devices. This module has a dependency on the driver-module.


#### 3.2.3 Driver Extension Framework
There is a provision to have a *pre* and *post* APIs for important driver/module functions such as probe, init, exit. These pre and post functionalities can be vendor specific, if required, and need to be defined by each vendor in a separate vendor-specific API module. A generic implementation of *show* or *store* APIs are provided for each Device-Data attribute. However, if needed vendor can provide their own implementation for these APIs. Such definitions should also go into the vendor-specific API module.



#### 3.2.4 JSON Descriptor Files
There are multiple JSON files which must be provided by a PDDF developer.  The list of information provided by the JSON files is below,

 - Platform Inventory Info:
	 -  Details like number of fans, PSUs, ports etc
 - Device Parsing Info
 - I2C Topology Info
 - Device Access info
 - Value Maps Info for various device-data Attributes, etc.


### 3.3 Generic Devcie-Object Class Design

![Figure2: PSU Generic Object Class](images/pddf_generic_plugin_psu_2.0.png "PSU Generic Object Class")


Generic device-object classes are extended from respective base classes but do not have any platform specific data. All the platform specific data mentioned below, is retrieved from JSON files.
  * Platform inventory
  * SysFS paths of various device attributes
  * Platform dependent interpretations of some of the attribute values 

Important thing to note in this type of design is that the PDDF has standardized the attribute names, and it provides the ability to map it to driver supported attribute names. Since PDDF provides the drivers for most of the devices, it maintains a list of device attributes. If there is a need to use a non-PDDF custom/standard driver, user must provide the list of attributes supported (which might be used by the generic object classes) by that driver. If such driver uses different name for an attribute, then it is incumbent that the user also define the driver attribute name.
Example below shows the usage of a driver 'ym2651' for a PSU1-PMBUS device. Generic PSU and FAN object class uses an attribute name *psu_fan_dir*. However, if the same information is denoted in the driver by *psu_fan_direction*, then user indicates this by the field *drv_attr_name*.
```
"PSU1-PMBUS": {
	"dev_info": {
		"device_type": "PSU-PMBUS",
		"device_name": "PSU1-PMBUS",
		"device_parent": "MUX3",
		"virt_parent": "PSU1"
	},
	"i2c": {
		"topo_info": {
		    "parent_bus": "0x30",
		    "dev_addr": "0x58",
		    "dev_type": "ym2851"
		},
		"attr_list": [
			{ "attr_name": "psu_fan1_fault" },
			{ "attr_name": "psu_v_out" },
			{ "attr_name": "psu_i_out" },
			{ "attr_name": "psu_p_out" },
			{ "attr_name": "psu_temp1_input" },
			{ "attr_name": "psu_fan1_speed_rpm" },
			{
				"attr_name":"psu_fan_dir",
				"drv_attr_name": "psu_fan_direction"
			},
			{ "attr_name": "psu_mfr_id" }
		]
	}
}
```
List of supported attribute names are mentioned under each device's generic object class. Path for each attribute's SysFS is retrieved and is cached so that each time object class is used, it doesn't calculate the path again.


### 3.4 PDDF I2C Component Design

#### 3.4.1 List of Supported HW Components
PDDF supports I2C based HW design consisting of the following components:

 - Fan Controller (CPLD or dedicated Controller EM2305) 
 - PSUs (YM2651, Ym2851, etc.,) 
 - Temp Sensors (LM75, LM90, TMP411, etc.,) 
 - Optics (SFP/QSFPs, EEPROM, etc.,) 
 - System EEPROM (at24, etc.,) 
 - CPLDs 
 - MUX  (PCA954x,..) 
 - GPIO  (PCA955x,..) 
 - System LEDs managed by CPLD etc.,

#### 3.4.2 I2C Topology Descriptor
Generally a platform consist of fans, PSUs, temperature sensors, CPLDs, optics (SFP, QSFPs etc), eeproms and multiplexing devices. I2C topology refers to the parent-child and other connectivity details of the I2C devices for a platform. The path to reach any device can be discerned using the I2C topology.

Example,

![Figure3: PSU Topology Data](images/pddf_topo_psu.png "PSU Topology Data")


I2C topology data consist of information such as *parent_bus*, *dev_addr* and *dev_type*. Users would describe the I2C topology data using a JSON Topology descriptor file .
*dev_info* object is used to represent the logical device.
*i2c* and *topo_info* are used for creating the I2C client.

```
"FAN-CPLD":
    {
        "dev_info": {
	        "device_type":"FAN",
	        "device_name":"FAN-CPLD",
	        "device_parent":"MUX2"
		},
        "i2c":
        {
	        "topo_info": {
		        "parent_bus":"0x20",
		        "dev_addr":"0x66",
		        "dev_type":"fan_ctrl"
		        },
	        ...
		}
}
```
Here is a brief explanation of the fields in topology JSON

> **device_type**: This mentions the generic device type. It can be either of these, PSU, FAN, CPLD, MUX, GPIO, EEPROM, SFP, etc. This is a mandatory field.

> **device_name**: This is the name of the device in the I2C topology. There can be a number or a substring appended to uniquely identify the device. e.g. FAN-CPLD, PSU1, PSU2, PORT1, MUX2, GPIO1 etc. This is an optional field.

> **device_parent**: This gives the name of the parent device in the topology. It is also a mandatory field.

> **i2c** object is put to differentiate with other mode of access such as PCI or BMC etc. **topo_info** gives the info to generate the I2C client. All the fields inside topo_info are mandatory.

> **parent_bus**: This denotes the bus number to which device is connected.

> **dev_addr**: This denotes the I2C address in the range of <0x0-0xff>.

> **dev_type**: This denotes the name/type of device. This should match with the dev_id of the device inside the supporting driver.


If there is a MUX in path, its connected devices are mentioned under an array *channel*. Here is an example,

```
"MUX2": {
	"dev_info": {
		"device_type":"MUX",
		"device_name":"MUX2",
		"device_parent":"MUX1"
	},
	"i2c": {
		"topo_info": {
		    "parent_bus":"0x10",
		    "dev_addr":"0x76",
		    "dev_type":"pca9548"
		},
		"dev_attr": {"virt_bus":"0x20"},
		"channel": [ 
		    { "chn":"0", "dev":"FAN-CPLD" },
		    { "chn":"2", "dev":"CPLD1" }
		]
	}
}
```
If the object is a MUX, then
> **virt_bus**: This is an information used internally to denote the base address for the channels of the mux. So if the virt_bus is 0x20 for a pca9548 then channel-buses are addressed as (0x20+0), (0x20+1), (0x20+2) ....  , (0x20+7).

> **channel**: This array gives info about the child devices for a mux. It mentions **chn** denoting the channel number, and **dev** denoting the device_name connected to this channel.

If an object is a GPIO (IO expander), then
> **gpio_bse**: This mentions the base number for GPIO pin. Ports/Pins would be assigned the number (gpio_base+i) where i port number within the IO expander.

> **ports**: This represents the list of the ports IO expander. Only those ports are mentioned in this list for which some initialization setting is required. It gives the values for various SysFs attributes for initialization.
```
"GPIO1":
{
    "dev_info": { "device_type":"GPIO", "device_name":"GPIO1", "device_parent":"MUX1"},
    "i2c":
    {
        "topo_info": { "parent_bus":"0x13", "dev_addr":"0x23", "dev_type":"pca9555"},
        "dev_attr": { "gpio_base":"0x10"},
        "ports":
        [
            {"port_num":"5", "direction":"out", "value":"1", "edge":"", "active_low":""}
        ]
    }
}
```
Some platforms require initialization settings to be performed with respect to the GPIOs. The **ports** list in the JSON obkect takes care of these initialization after the I2C device creation takes place. Following are the names of 
GPIO's SysFs attributes created by the standard linux driver.

> **port_num**: GPIO Port/Pin number.

> **direction**: Either "in" or "out". Generally this value is to be written. Writing as "out" defaults to initializing the value as low. It is optional field, i.e. if GPIO pin requires initialization by setting th
 provided here.

> **value**: Either "0" or "1". This value must be written if the GPIO is configured as output.

> **edge**: Either "none", "rising", "falling" or "both". Mentions the signal edge where the **value** is polled.

> **active_low**: Either "0" or "1".



If the object is PSU, then
> **psu_idx**: This is used internally to denote the PSU number. It is also a mandatory field.

> **interface**: Here the user needs to define the PSU interface, eeprom and pmbus, for which I2C clients would be created. If user needs to use only pmbus client to get all the information, then only that should be mentioned.

```
"PSU1":
{
    "dev_info": {
	    "device_type":"PSU",
	    "device_name":"PSU1",
	    "device_parent":"MUX3"
	},
    "dev_attr": { "psu_idx":"1"},
    "i2c": {
	    "interface": [  
			{ "itf":"pmbus", "dev":"PSU1-PMBUS" },
			{ "itf":"eeprom", "dev":"PSU1-EEPROM" }
		]
    },
}
```

PDDF tools will use descriptor file data to instantiate I2C client devices and populate per-platform data.

#### 3.4.3 PSU Component
PDDF has a PSU module and a PSU driver module.
##### 3.4.3.1 PSU Driver Modules
PDDF PSU module is used to
  * Create the access data attributes to transfer the access data from user space to kernel.
  * Populates the access data into PSU client's *platform_data*
  * Create the PSU I2C client

Usually every PSU device has two interfaces and hence two I2C clients.
  1. EEPROM interface
  2. SMBUS interface

It is possible that all the required PSU info can be read using SMBUS interface itself. In such cases, only one SMBUS device needs to be created, and all the SysFS attributes shall be  created under this device.

PDDF PSU driver is used for both the interfaces and SysFS attributes are divided among the two. PSU driver module has the following functionalities,
  * Create the SysFS data attributes 
  * Get/Set  attribute's value from/to HW 

Currently supported PSU SysFS Attributes are:
```
psu_present  
psu_model_name  
psu_power_good  
psu_mfr_id  
psu_serial_num  
psu_fan_dir  
psu_v_out  
psu_i_out  
psu_p_out  
psu_fan1_speed_rpm
```
##### 3.4.3.2 PSU JSON Design
PSU JSON is structured to include the access-data for all the supported SysFS attributes.
*attr_list* is an array object which stores the array of access-data for multiple  attributes. If some of the field in the attribute object is not applicable to some particular attribute, it can be left and not filled.

Description of the fields inside *attr_list*
> **attr_name**:  This field denotes the name of SysFS attribute associated with this device I2C client. It is a mandatory field.

> **attr_devaddr**: This denotes the I2C address of device from where this SysFS attribute value is to be read. e.g if *psu_present* is the SysFS attribute, and it needs to be read from a CPLD, the I2C address of that CPLD is to be mentioned here.

> **attr_devtype**: Source device type of the value of SysFS attribute.

> **attr_offset**: Register offset of the SysFS attribute.

> **attr_mask**: Mask to be applied to read value.

> **attr_cmpval**: Expected reg value after applying the mask.  This is used to provide a Boolean value to the attribute. e.g `attr_val = ((reg_val & attr_mask) == attr_cmpval)` .

##### 3.4.3.3 PSU Object Class Design
PsuBase is the base PSU class, which declares various APIs to get/set information from the PSU devices. PDDF PSU generic object class **Psu** shall extend from PsuBase and implement the platform specific APIs, using the platform specific information in the JSON descriptor files

Example,
```
def get_voltage(self):
    """
    Retrieves current PSU voltage output

    Returns:
        A float number, the output voltage in volts,
        e.g. 12.1
    """
    # Implementation to get PSU output voltage using the JSON descriptor files
```

#### 3.4.4 FAN Component
Fan has a PDDF device module and a PDDF device driver module.

##### 3.4.4.1 FAN Driver Modules
PDDF fan module is used to
  * Create the access data attributes to transfer the access data from user space to kernel.
  * Populates the access data into FAN client's *platform_data*
  * Create the fan I2C client

There could be one or multiple client for fan controller. If any other controller is used, such as EMC2305 or EMC2302 etc, then there might be multiple fan controller clients .

PDDF fan driver is used for all the fan clients and SysFS attributes are divided. Fan driver module has the following functionalities,
 * Create the SysFS attributes 
  * Get/Set SysFS attribute's value from/to Fan controller devices

Supported Fan SysFS attributes are:

```
fan<idx>_present  
fan<idx>_direction  
fan<idx>_input  # denoting fan speed
fan<idx>_pwm  
fan<idx>_fault  
where idx represents the Fan index [1..6]
```

Since PDDF has been changed to support platform 2.0 APIs, general design considers all the FANs inside a fantray as seperate FANs. If a fantray consist of two fans, front and rear, JSON object for FAN not only provides the access details for the front fan but also for the rear fan.

##### 3.4.4.2 FAN JSON Design
FAN JSON is structured to include the access-data for all the supported SysFS attributes.
*attr_list* is an array object which stores the array of access-data for multiple  attributes. If some of the field in the attribute object is not applicable to some particular attribute, it can be left out.

Description of the objects inside *attr_list* which are very specific to Fan components are:

> **attr_mult**: Multiplication factor to the value to get the FAN rpm.

> **attr_is_divisor**: If the register value is a divisor  to the multiplication factor  to get the FAN rpm.

##### 3.4.4.3 FAN Object Class Design
FanBase is the base FAN class, which declares various APIs to get/set information from the Fan devices. PDDF Fan generic object class **Fan** shall extend from FanBase and implement the platform specific APIs, using the platform specific information in the JSON descriptor files. FanBase is part of the new platform API framework in SONiC.

Example,
```
	def get_direction(self):
		"""
		Retrieves the direction of fan
		Returns:
		A string, either FAN_DIRECTION_INTAKE or FAN_DIRECTION_EXHAUST
		depending on fan direction
		"""
        # Implementation using JSON descriptor files

	def get_speed(self):
		"""
		Retrieves the speed of fan in rpms
		Returns:
		An integer, denoting the rpm (revolutions per minute) speed
		"""
        # Implementation using JSON descriptor files

```

#### 3.4.5 LED Component
Network switches have a variety of LED lights, system LEDs, Fan Tray LEDs, and port LEDs, used to act as indicators of switch status and network port status.  The system LEDs are used to indicate the status of power and the system. The fan tray LEDs indicate each fan status. The port LEDs are used to indicate the state of the links such as link up, Tx/RX activity and speed. The Port LEDs are in general managed by the LED controller provided by switch vendors. The scope of this LED section  is for system LEDs and fan tray LEDs.     

##### 3.4.5.1 LED Driver Design    
LEDs are controlled via CPLDs. LEDs status can be read and set via I2C interfaces. A platform-independent driver is designed to access CPLDs via I2c interfaces. CPLD/register address data is stored in platform-specific JSON file. User python device-object classes trigger drivers to read/write LED statuses via SysFS. This generic LED driver is implemented to control System LED and Fan Tray LED.  

##### 3.4.5.2 JSON Design    
   This section provides examples of configuring platform, System LED and Fantray LED.  They are consisted of key/value pairs. Each pair has a unique name. The table describes the naming convention for each unique key.

                    }  


##### 3.4.5.3 LED Object Class Design
There is no generic LED object class defined in PDDF. LED APIs related to a component has been made part of thats component's object class. System LED APIs are made part of chassis object class.

#### 3.4.6 Sensors

##### 3.4.6.1 Driver Design  
The Linux driver supports LM75/LM90 compatible temperature sensors.  It is used to support communication through the I2C bus and interfaces with the hardware monitoring sub-system. A SysFS interface is added to let the user provides the temperature sensors information to the kernel to instantiate I2C devices.   

##### 3.4.6.2 JSON Design
Platform specific temperature sensor configuration file is designed to instantiate I2c devices and provides access information for object classes. These data are grouped into three sections: PLATFORM, I2C Topology and TEMP Data. PLATFORM section provides the number of temperature sensors. I2C Topology section and TEMP Data are used for instantiating I2C devices and accessing temperature sensors vis SysFS attributes.      
They are consisted of key/value sections. Each section has a unique name. The table describes the naming convention for each unique key.     

| **Key**                 | **Description**                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| PLATFORM                      | Numbers of temperature sensors        |

                }  
##### 3.4.6.3 Thermal Object Class Design  
A generic user space python object calss **Thermal**  is designed to access temperature sensors via SysFS interface. It gets SysFS path information from platform-specific JSON File, pal-device.json. It also uses the ThermalBase class. It provides various APIs to retrieve the number of temp sensors, temperature sensor readings and get high&low threshold temperatures etc.
```
Class Thermal(ThermalBase):
    def get_temperature(self):
        """
        Retrieves current temperature reading from thermal
        Returns:
            A float number of current temperature in Celsius up to nearest thousandth

#### 3.4.7 System EEPROM Component

##### 3.4.7.1 Driver Design
For SYS EEPROM component, PDDF leverages the existing Linux standard driver **at24**. This driver supports multiple variations of the EEPROM viz. 24c00, 24c01, 24c08, 24c16, 24c512 and many more. This driver provides one SysFS device-data attribute named **eeprom**. Since standard driver is being used for EEPROM, PDDF uses user-space command to instantiate the EEPROM device.
Example,
> echo 24c02 0x57 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/new_device

##### 3.4.7.2 JSON Design
For SYS EEPROM, the client creation information is present in I2C Topology JSON file. Since the driver is standard and attribute-name is fixed, *eeprom*, there is no component specific JSON file representing the access-data. Example of the SYS EEPROM entry in the topology JSON is mentioned below.
```
"EEPROM1": {
  "dev_info": {
    "device_type": "EEPROM",
    "device_name": "EEPROM1",
    "device_parent": "SMBUS0"
  },
  "i2c": {
    "topo_info": {
      "parent_bus": "0x0",
      "dev_addr": "0x57",
      "dev_type": "at24"
    },
    "dev_attr": {"access_mode": "BLOCK"}
  }
},
```

##### 3.4.7.3 EEPROM Object Class Design
A generic user space object class is written for EEPROM. Internally it leverages eeprom_base and eeprom_tlvinfo base classes. The SysFS path for driver supported attribute is retrieved from the user provided JSON file. An example of the API definition form eeprom_base is shown below,
```
def check_status(self):
    if self.u != '':
        F = open(self.u, "r")
        d = F.readline().rstrip()
        F.close()
        return d
    else:
        return 'ok'

def set_cache_name(self, name):
    # before accessing the eeprom we acquire an exclusive lock on the eeprom file.
    # this will prevent a race condition where multiple instances of this app
    # could try to update the cache at the same time
    self.cache_name = name
    self.lock_file = open(self.p, 'r')
    fcntl.flock(self.lock_file, fcntl.LOCK_EX)
```
Generic object class may provide further initialization steps and definitions for new APIs.


#### 3.4.8 System Status Registers

##### 3.4.8.1 Driver Design
System Status information is present in CPLD registers. These information can be retrieved from CPLD using I2C interface to the CPLDs. Access-data to retrieve *system status* information is provided by the user in a JSON file. A generic driver is written in PDDF to store all the access-data in kernel space, and use it to read information from CPLDs. The system status data attributes are created under `/sys/kernel/pal/devices/sysstatus/data/`.

##### 3.4.8.2 JSON Design
An example of object from system status JSON file is shown below,
```
"SYSSTATUS": {
  "attr_list": [
    { "attr_name":"board_info","attr_devaddr":"0x60", "attr_offset":"0x0","attr_mask":"0x1f","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"cpld1_version","attr_devaddr":"0x60","attr_offset":"0x1","attr_mask":"0xff","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"power_module_status","attr_devaddr":"0x60","attr_offset":"0x2","attr_mask":"0x1f","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"system_reset5","attr_devaddr":"0x60","attr_offset":"0x50","attr_mask":"0xff","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"system_reset6","attr_devaddr":"0x60", "attr_offset":"0x51","attr_mask":"0xff","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"system_reset7","attr_devaddr":"0x60","attr_offset":"0x52","attr_mask":"0xff","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"system_reset8","attr_devaddr":"0x60","attr_offset":"0x53","attr_mask":"0xff","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"misc1","attr_devaddr":"0x60","attr_offset":"0x68","attr_mask":"0xff","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"cpld2_version","attr_devaddr":"0x62","attr_offset":"0x1","attr_mask":"0xff","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"interrupt_status","attr_devaddr":"0x62","attr_offset":"0x2","attr_mask":"0xf","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"system_reset","attr_devaddr":"0x62","attr_offset":"0x3","attr_mask":"0x1","attr_len":1},
    { "attr_name":"misc2","attr_devaddr":"0x62","attr_offset":"0x68","attr_mask":"0x2","attr_len":1}
  ]
},
```
This SYSTATUS JSON object can be used to get miscellaneous info from various CPLDs/devices based on the platform. Currently there is no generic object class/plugin defined for system status registers. 

#### 3.4.9 Optics Component
##### 3.4.9.1	Driver design

Transceiver devices (SFP, QSFP etc.) expose mainly two kinds of access/control methods.  
  * EEPROM read/write access on linear address space of 256\*128 byte paged memory.
  * Device control attributes exposed as control pins via external CPLD/FPGA device.

In existing implementations, the drivers that access these attributes are very platform dependent. They depend on exactly which CPLD is managing which pin on each SFP device. And that’s different for every switch, even for similar switches from the same vendor. In SONiC, this is handled by having the switch vendor provide that driver, for each platform.

For eeprom access, OOM based 'optoe' is leveraged which exposes the eeprom as a binary attribute under the device tree. Optoe is independent of switches, because it only depends on I2C, and the EEPROM architecture, both of which are standardized. Linux provides a common I2C interface, which hides the switch dependent addressing to get to the device.

Each of of these SysFS attributes are distributed across multiple devices based on their implementation. The PDDF generic drivers provide a common interface to initialize and manage all the attributes. PDDF model for optics requires that every given port on switch should be associated with optoe as well as PAL optic driver to expose and support SysFS attributes related to optical transceivers.

The commonly used Optic SysFS attribute list include:
```
EEPROM bin        
Module presence
Low power mode
Module reset
Rx LOS
Tx Disable
Tx Fault etc..
```
**Generic Optic PDDF drivers:**

PDDF has the following three different drivers for optics.
* Optoe driver
* Optic_pddf_module
* Optic_pddf_driver_module

#### Optoe driver:
* Responsible for creation of SFP I2C client under the given parent bus.
	1) Devices with one I2C address (eg QSFP) use I2C address 0x50 (A0h)
	2) Devices with two I2C addresses (eg SFP) use I2C address 0x50(A0h) and 0x51(A2h)
* Expose eeprom bin attribute under the same path.

#### Optic_pddf_module:
  * Create the access data attributes to transfer the access data from user space to kernel.
  * Populates the access data into SFP client's *platform_data*. (Information collected from the JSON parsing)
  * Registers a virtual SFP I2C client with address 0x60 (User defined).
#### Optic_pddf_driver_module:
Driver module has the following functionalities,
  * Allocate the memory dynamically to *driver_data* and supported SysFS attributes
  * Create the SysFS attributes and link it to Optic_Pal client's kernel object
  * Retrieve the SysFS attribute's value from HW and update the *driver_data*

##### 3.4.9.2 JSON Design

Optic JSON is structured to include the access-data for all the supported SysFS attributes.
*attr_list* is an array object which stores the array of access-datas for multiple attributes. Some of these values can be left empty if they are not applicable.

##### 3.4.9.3 Optics Object Class Design

SfpBase is the base Optic class, which declares various APIs to get/set information from the optic transceivers. PDDF generic object class **Sfp** shall extend from SfpBase and implement the platform specific APIs, using the platform specific information in the JSON descriptor files.

Example,
```
    def get_transceiver_info(self):
        """
        Retrieves transceiver info of this SFP

        Returns:
            A dict which contains following keys/values :
        ========================================================================

#### 3.4.10 lm-sensors Tools
lm-sensors package (Linux monitoring sensors) provides tools and drivers for monitoring temperatures, voltages, and fan speeds via command line. It can monitoring hardware such the LM75 and LM78. These tools are described below. These tools would continue to work with PDDF framework too.

##### 3.4.10.1 sensors.conf  
/etc/sensors.conf is a user customized configuration file for libsensors. It describes how libsensors, and so all programs using it, should translate the raw readings from the kernel modules to real-world values. A user can configure each chip, feature and sub-feature that makes sense for his/her system.     

    Example:
    sensors.conf:
         bus "i2c-3" "i2c-1-mux (chan_id 1)"
         chip "lm75-i2c-3-49"  
         label temp1 "Temp Sensor"
         set temp1_max 60
         set temp1_max_hyst 56

     admin@sonic:~$ sensors  
         lm75-i2c-3-49
         Adapter: i2c-1-mux (chan_id 1)
         Temp Sensor:        +27.0 C  (high = +60.0 C, hyst = +56.0 C)

This would continue to be supported using PDDF driver framework as well.

##### 3.4.10.2 fancontrol:

fancontrol is a shell script for use with lm_sensors. It reads its configuration from a file, /etc/fancontrol, then calculates fan speeds from temperatures and sets the corresponding PWM outputs to the computed values.  

    # fancontrol /etc/fancontrol

    Example of configuration file   
    INTERVAL=10
    FCTEMPS=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0066/pwm1=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0066/sys_temp

    MINTEMP=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0066/pwm1=135
    MAXTEMP=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0066/pwm1=160

    MINPWM=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0066/pwm1=32
    MAXPWM=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0066/pwm1=69

The SysFS paths should be given as per the PDDF I2C topology description and the attributes.
