## Detailed requirements

### Overview

The Ethernet switches of today have evolved and are entering several key segments providing switch chips for enterprise, data-center, and carrier, as well as optical transceivers, Gearbox PHYs and 25Gbps Re-timers.

If the platform/hardware supports it, the PHY may be configurable to speeds including 10G, 25G, 40G, 50G, and 100G, and beyond. Some platforms contain and external PHY, while others have PHYs embedded in the switch ASIC (Internal PHY). An External PHY is used to serve different purposes like gearbox, Re-timer, MACSEC and multi gigabit Ethernet PHY transceivers, etc. 

The Abstraction Interface contains a set of SAI APIs providing new functionality in support of the most recent PHY advancements and requirements.

Through utilizing this new external PHY interface, this project adds configuration and management capabilities for these new external PHY requirements.

#### External PHY Specification
The initial specification of the external PHY is contained in a new configuration file and changes to some existing configuration files;
- sai.profile
- port_config.ini - sonic user port config 
- lanemap.ini - line side
- \<platform\>\<hwsku\>.bcm
- gearbox.ini
  * firmware location
  * lane maps - system-side of MAC and PHY
  * external PHY and ASIC topology
  * external PHY library name

#### External PHY Firmware Management
Firmware must be downloaded and initialized before any PHY configurations, etc.

**PHY firmware boot methods:**

- From flash chip connected to the external EEPROM using SPI
- From PHYâ€™s IRAM and DRAM via the MDIO interface

**Typical Firmware download methods:**

| Method      | Description     |
|-------------|-----------------|
| No Download | Do not download |
| Internal    | MDIO download   |
| EPROM       | From Flash      |

**Typical Firmware load methods:**

| Method | Description                        |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| Force  | Always download                    |
| Skip   | If firmware exits, do not download |
| Auto   | Version mismatch                   |

The following CLI commands are provided to assist with firmware download and initialization;

- config (Not required at this time)
- show (future)

### Functionality

The following is a summary of modifications made to new and existing components.

#### ***orchagent (existing)***
The orchagent manages various daemons; portsyncd, portmgrd, intfmgrd, etc. Enhancements are made to detect and manage the new Gearbox agent; gearsyncd and is only executed on platforms configured with External PHYs.

#### ***gearsyncd (new)***
In order to separate feature and function, the gearsyncd is a new/separate daemon running in coordination with the Orchestration Agent under the SWSS Docker. After reading and processing the gearbox and phy configuration files, similar to the portsyncd daemon, it creates all host interfaces and signals the orchagent indicating that port creation and initialization is done.

#### ***portsyncd (existing)***
The existing port configuration functionality is disabled when Gearbox is enabled. However, all Netlink event processing is still performed.

#### ***portsorch (existing/new)***
A new Gearbox's doGearTask is spawned from within the portsorch agent when Gearbox is enabled. Similar to doPortTask, doGearTask creates and initializes the associated SAI ports but for Gearbox.

### Serviceability
Standard logging is instrumented for existing components (as well as the Gearbox Manager), for example;
1. SWSS/orchagents:
  * *SWSS_LOG_XXX*
2. syncd:
  * *SAI_LOG_LEVEL_XXX*
3. Will make use of the new SONiC Debug Framework

 
### Platforms
The Gearbox Manager and its implementation is not specific to any platform, but rather the existence of External PHYs.

### Limitations
The Gearbox Manager is limited to the existence of specific External PHY platform/hardware capabilities. The Gearbox Manager is loaded and initialized **only upon detection of configured External PHYs**.
