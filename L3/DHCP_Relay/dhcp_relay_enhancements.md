# 1 Feature Overview

DHCP relay is used to forward DHCP packets between client and server when they are not in the same L3 network. 


## 1.1 Requirements
### 1.1.1 Functional Requirements
1. Support relaying of IPv4 DHCP packets.
2. Support appending Circuit ID and Remote ID sub-options(option 82) for IPv4 DHCP packets.
3. Support rate limiting for DHCP packets.

5. Support relay functionality in VRFs.
6. Support configuration of up to 4 relay addresses per L3 interface.
7. Support configuration of relay addresses on Physical, VLAN, Port channel interfaces and Port channel interfaces in L3 MCLAG.
8. Support DHCP Relay Statistics per interface.
9. Support DHCP Relay Option 82 Link selection sub-option - RFC 3527
10. Support configuration of source interface for relayed packets.
11. Support DHCP relay over RFC 5549 routes learned via BGP IPv6 link-local neighbors (BGP Unnumbered).
12. Support DHCP clients and DHCP servers in different VRF domains.
13. Support DHCP relay over VxLAN overlay tunnels.
14. Support configuration of maximum number of relay hops. 
15. Support relaying of DHCPv4 packets over IPv4 unnumbered interfaces.
16. Support Virtual subnet selection (VSS) options 151/152 for DHCPv4, and VSS option 68 for DHCPv6, as per RFC 6607.
17. Support relaying of DHCPv4/DHCPv6 packets when client and server are in different VRFs.
18. Support DHCPv4/DHCPv6 relay over L3 subinterfaces. Unless otherwise specified, all existing DHCPv4/DHCPv6 functional requirements are supported on L3 subinterfaces.
19. Support configuration of DHCP relay option 82 circuit-id format per L3 interface.


### 1.1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements
1. Provide configuration and management commands using python Click module based framework.
2. Provide per interface configuration command to add/delete DHCP relay addresses.
3. Provide per interface show command to display the DHCP relay statistics.
4. Provide a show command to display the configured relay addresses.
5. Support for OpenConfig YANG model - see [relay-agent.yang](https://github.com/openconfig/public/blob/master/release/models/relay-agent/openconfig-relay-agent.yang) for more details.
6. Support for KLISH CLI commands using management framework.
7. Provide configuration option to specify VRF in which the server resides.
8. Provide configuration option to specify forwarding behavior  of DHCPv4 packets that already contain relay agent options.
9. All configuration changes must be applied with out restarting the DHCP relay docker.
10. Extend Click/KLISH configuration and show commands to support DHCPv4/DHCPv6 relay on L3 subinterfaces.
11. Provide per interface configuration option to include hostname/interface name/interface MAC address in DHCP relay option 82 circuit-id.

### 1.1.3 Scalability Requirements
#### 1.1.3.1 New Scalability Requirements
1. The maximum number of L3 interfaces that can be enabled for DHCPv4 relay is 4K.
2. The maximum number of L3 interfaces that can be enabled for DHCPv6 relay is 4K. 

#### 1.1.3.2 Existing Scalability Requirements
1. The maximum number of Relay addresses configurable per interface are 4. 
2. DHCPv4/v6 relay is qualified to handle up to 2000 DHCP clients.

Note that the 4K limit on L3 interfaces is not enforced via configuration, but represents the maximum scale that is qualified/supported. The number of L3 interfaces is dependent on the underlying platform and can be less than 4K.  

### 1.1.4 Warm Boot Requirements
DHCP Relay configuration is stateless and hence no state is restored after warm reboot. Any UDP broadcast traffic that is relayed to IP Helper addresses is disrupted/dropped during the duration of the warm reboot or normal reboot.

## 1.2 Design Overview
### 1.2.1 Basic Approach

A DHCP relay daemon is spawned as part for DHCP relay docker and is responsbile for:

* registering with CONFIG_DB to process configuration changes
* registering UDP socket to send/receive DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 packets
* updating DHCPv4/DHCPv6 TX/RX statistics to COUNTERS_DB

Note: The previous ISC DHCP solution has been deprecated due to scaling issues and an in-house implementation is added to support DHCP relay on 4K L3 interfaces.

__Figure2: DHCP Relay Deployment with MCLAG__

### 2.1.1 MCLAG guidelines

In MCLAG deployments, the following configuration guidelines need to be considered:

- The DHCP Relay configuration should be the same on both the MC-LAG peer switches with same set of DHCP servers.
- The DHCP Relay must be configured to use link-selection and source interface options. This is to ensure that response from server is received by the switch that relayed the DHCP packet.
- DHCP server must be reachable from both the MC-LAG peers.
- Clients may send the DHCP DISCOVER packet to either of the MC-LAG peers.
- The DHCP DISCOVER packet from client can be relayed by either of the MC-LAG peers.


**Sample configuration MC-LAG Peer switch:**

```
## Create Loopback
config loopback add Loopback0
config interface ip add Loopback0 103.103.103.103/32

## Create client VLAN
config vlan add 100

## Create client facing Port-channel
config portchannel add PortChannel101 --fallback true

## Add client port to the Port-channel
config portchannel member add PortChannel101 Ethernet1

## Setup MCLAG using loopback IP and Peer link 
config mclag add 1 103.103.103.103 113.113.113.133 Ethernet2

## Add Port-channel to MCLAG
config mclag member add 1 PortChannel101

## Add peer link and Port-channel to VLAN 100
config vlan member add 100 Ethernet2
config vlan member add -u 100 PortChannel101

## Configure IP address on the VLAN 100 interface
config interface ip add Vlan100 10.1.1.1/24

## Enable DHCP relay on VLAN 100 with link-selection and source interface
config interface ip dhcp_relay add Vlan100 55.55.55.1 -link-select=enable -src-intf=Loopback0
```

## 2.2 Functional Description
Generally, the DHCP packets are broadcast. These broadcast packets cannot be exchanged between DHCP server and client that are not in the same subnet. The DHCP Relay enables DHCP packets to be exchanged between the server and client that are not in the same subnet. The DHCP relay converts the broadcast packets to unicast and forwards them to DHCP server.

# 3 Design
## 3.1 Overview

To implement DHCP relay functionality, a relay manager process `dhcprelaymgrd` is spawned as part of the `dhcp_relay` docker. The process handles both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 packets. It is marked as a critical process so that any process termination event will cause the DHCP docker to restart and spawn the process again.

Below are the supervisor settings for the DHCP relay process.
```
[program:dhcprelaymgrd]
command=/usr/bin/dhcprelaymgrd
priority=4
autostart=false
autorestart=false
stdout_logfile=syslog
stderr_logfile=syslog
```

The relay manager creates one global UDP socket to receive and transmit DHCPv4/v6 packets from different interfaces in different VRFs. The DHCPv4 socket  is bound to UDP port 67, and the DHCPv6 socket is bound to UDP port 547. If the DHCP server resides in a VRF that is different from client, then an additional UDP socket is created to relay DHCPv4/v6 packets in the server VRF - this socket is bound to the server VRF. To determine the incoming interface of the received packet, IP_PKTINFO/IPV6_RECVPKTINFO socket options are enabled.

```
    socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP);  /* Global DHCPv4 socket */ 
    socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP); /* Global DHCPv6 socket */
```

For DHCPv4 packets received from the client, the relay manager appends the option 82 - Circuit ID and remote ID. The format of option 82 is not configurable. The Circuit ID is formatted based on the incoming interface name and the Remote ID is formatted based on the MAC address of the incoming interface.  When DHCP server responds to the relay agent, the relay manager strips the Option 82 and identifies the client interface using the Circuit ID and Remote ID fields in the response. The DHCP server response is then forwarded to the client interface. Below is a sample IPv4 DHCP relayed packet with option 82.

```
Option: (82) Agent Information Option
  Length: 31
  Option 82 Suboption: (1) Agent Circuit ID
      Length: 10
      Agent Circuit ID: 45746865726e65743130 ("Ethernet 10")
  Option 82 Suboption: (2) Agent Remote ID
      Length: 17
      Agent Remote ID: 63633a33373a61623a31373a36633a3961 ("cc:37:ab:17:6c:9a")
```

The relay manager registers with the following CONFIG_DB tables to receive updates to the DHCP relay configuration parameters:

```
{
     CFG_INTF_TABLE_NAME,
     CFG_LAG_INTF_TABLE_NAME,
     CFG_VLAN_TABLE_NAME,
     CFG_VLAN_SUB_INTF_TABLE_NAME,
     CFG_VLAN_INTF_TABLE_NAME,
     CFG_LOOPBACK_INTERFACE_TABLE_NAME,
     CFG_SAG_TABLE_NAME,
     CFG_SAG_GLOBAL_TABLE_NAME
}
```

### 3.1.1 Option 82 Link-selection sub-option
Typically, DHCP deployment involves a single routing domain between the client and server.  In such deployments, the 'giaddr' in relayed packet is used to identify the client subnet and also to communicate with the relay agent. In some networks, the client and server could be in different domains and may not be able to communicate directly. This is done to isolate the server from client attacks. In such scenarios, there is a need to differentiate the client subnet and the relay agent address ('giaddr').

The link selection suboption provides a mechanism to explicitly specify the subnet on which the DHCP client resides, which is different from 'giaddr'. The relay agent adds the suboption to specify the client subnet and the DHCP server uses the sub-option value (instead of giaddr) to assign the DHCP lease. The relay agent also sets the 'giaddr' value to its own IP address which is reachable from DHCP server. Refer to RFC 3527 for more details.  The link-selection sub-option is only added by the first relay agent, which implies 'giaddr' of incoming packet has to be NULL, else the sub-option is not added. Note that the link-selection sub-option is intended for DHCPv4 clients only and is not applicable for DHCPv6 clients.

&nbsp;
![Figure3](./dhcp_link_selection.png "Figure3: DHCP Relay Option 82 Link selection sub-option")
&nbsp;
__Figure3: DHCP Relay Link selection__

1. DHCP client generates request. 
2. Relay agent intercepts and adds link-selection sub option with 192.168.0.1 address.
3. Relay agent sets the `giaddr` based on the source interface configured. If source interface is configured as loopback 0, the `giaddr` is set to 103.103.103.103. The `giaddr` must be reachable from the server.
4. Server identifies the client subnet from link-selection option and allocates address from the 192.168.0.x pool. Server generates the offer packet and sends it to  the IP address specified in the `giaddr`.

```
# Enable link select on incoming interface, specifying Loopback0 as source interface
config interface ip dhcp-relay add Ethernet0 172.16.0.2 -link-select=enable -src-intf=Loopback0
```

```
# DHCP message - relay agent options

Option: (82) Agent Information Option
  Length: 37
  Option 82 Suboption: (1) Agent Circuit ID
      Length: 10
      Agent Circuit ID: 45746865726e65743030 ("Ethernet 0")
  Option 82 Suboption: (2) Agent Remote ID
      Length: 17
      Agent Remote ID: 63633a33373a61623a31373a36633a3961 ("cc:37:ab:17:6c:9a")
  Option 82 Suboption: (5) Link Selection
      Length: 4
      Link selection: C0A80001 (192.168.0.1)
```

### 3.1.2 Hop limit
Clients typically set the hop count field in the DHCP packet to 0. When forwarding DHCP packets, the relay agent increments the hop count field  by 1. If the hop count in DHCP packet is greater than or equal to the maximum number of hops allowed by the relay agent, the incoming packet is discarded. The hop limit ensures that the DHCP packets are not looped in the network where multiple relay agents are present. The default value of the maximum number of hops is 10, and can be configured to a value from 1 through 16. The hop limit configuration is per-interface (client facing) and applies to both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 packets. The hop limit is only enforced for packets that are relayed to the server, it is not applied for response packets received from server. Interface counter is maintained to track the number of packets dropped due to hop limit.

```
# Set hop limit to 3 when enabling DHCP relay on Vlan100
config interface ip dhcp-relay max-hop-count add Vlan100 3
```

### 3.1.3 Source interface selection
DHCP relay provides a source interface configuration option which specifies the source address to be used for relayed packets. If the source interface is not specified, the source IP address in the relayed packet is automatically determined by the routing stack based on the outgoing interface. The Linux kernel chooses the first address configured on the interface which falls in the same network as the destination address or nexthop router.

The source interface configuration option is per-interface (client facing) and applies to both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 packets. For relaying DHCPv4 packets, the first IPv4 address of the source interface is used. For relaying DHCPv6 packets, the first IPv6 address of the source interface is used. If the configured source interface does not have any IP address, the source IP address in the relayed packet is determined by the routing stack based on the outgoing interface. If the address on the source interface is modified, then the relay agent picks up the updated IP address for relaying packets.

If link-selection sub-option is enabled, then it is mandatory to configure a source interface that is reachable from the server. Else, the link-selection sub-option is not added to the relayed packet.

```
# Set source interface to Loopback0, when enabling DHCP relay on Vlan100
config interface ip dhcp-relay src-intf add Vlan100 Loopback0
```

### 3.1.4 Relay over IPv6 next hops

In Datacenter network deployments, shown below, the DHCP server is reachable via IPv6 underlay network. DHCP relay is enabled on the Leaf1 switch, which has BGP neighborship with Spine1. The DHCP server is connected to Leaf2 switch which also has BGP neighborship with Spine1. The interfaces between Leaf and Spine do not have IPv4 address, but they are enabled for IPv6 forwarding using link-local address. BGP peering between Leaf and Spine switch is established using IPv6 link-local address. BGP supports RFC 5549, which allows an IPv4 prefix to be carried over an IPv6 next hop. On Leaf1, the IPv4 route to DHCP server is learned via BGP and points to the link-local nexthop of Spine1 (as shown below). Likewise, Spine1 also has similar IPv4 route that points to link-local nexthop of Leaf2.


&nbsp;
![Figure4](./dhcp_bgp_unnumbered.png "Figure4: DHCP Relay over IPv6 link-local nexthops")
__Figure4: DHCP Relay over IPv6 nexthops__
1. DHCP client generates request.
2. Relay agent on Leaf1 is configured to use source interface as Loopback0. Relay agent sets the `giaddr` and source IPv4 address to 103.103.103.103, and forwards the request to DHCP server (172.16.0.2) as per the BGP RFC 5549 route.  
3. Leaf2 receives the relayed DHCP request from Spine1 and forwards it to the DHCP server which is directly connected. 
4. DHCP Server receives the relayed DHCP request, generates the offer packet and sends it to  the IP address specified in the `giaddr`, which is the Leaf1 loopback address 103.103.103.103.
5. Leaf2 has BGP RFC5549 route to reach the loopback address of Leaf1 (103.103.103.130). The DHCP offer is forwarded to the relay agent as per the BGP route.
6. Leaf1 receives the response from DHCP server, strips option 82, and forwards it to client.

```
# Sample configuration for Leaf switch

# Enable IPv6 on the interface towards Spine
root@sonic:/# config interface ipv6 enable use-link-local-only Vlan400

# Enable DHCP relay on incoming interface Vlan100 and use Loopback0 as source
root@sonic:/# config interface ip dhcp-relay add Vlan100 172.16.0.2 -src-intf=Loopback0

# BGP configuration to establish adjacency with Spine and redistribute connected routes

#IPv4 route to the DHCP server pointing to IPv6 link-local nexthop
B>*  172.16.0.0/16 [200/0] via fe80::dac4:97ff:fe71:deb, Vlan400
```

### 3.1.5 VRF support

DHCP relay agent supports forwarding of client requests to a server located in a different VRF. For example, the client can be connected to an interface bound to default/global VRF, and the server can reside in user VRF. Likewise, the client can reside in user VRF, and the server can reside in default VRF.

To support such deployments, DHCP relay provides a configuration option to specify the VRF name in which the DHCP server resides. If the VRF name is not specified, it is assumed that the DHCP server resides in default VRF. DHCP relay supports configuring multiple DHCP servers for a given client interface, and all these DHCP servers must reside in the same VRF. There can be only one server VRF specified per client/downstream interface. 

Note that the client VRF is derived from the interface on which relay is configured.

&nbsp;
![Figure5](./dhcp_relay_across_vrf.png "Figure5: DHCP Relay across VRFs")
&nbsp;
__Figure5: DHCP Relay with VRF__

```
#Configure Relay with server VRF

config interface ip dhcp-relay add Ethernet0 172.16.0.1 -vrf-name=VrfRed
config interface ip dhcp-relay src-intf add Ethernet0 Loopback0
config interface ip dhcp-relay link-select add Ethernet0
```

In case of DHCPv4 relay, link-selection must be enabled when client and server are in different VRFs. The link-selection sub-option must use an interface that is bound to server VRF. This is needed to ensure that the response from the server is received by the DHCPv4 relay. If the client and server are in the same VRF, say VrfRed, then link-selection need not be enabled, as the 'giaddr' is also in the server VRF.

As an alternate configuration, route leaking can be enabled in client VRF to ensure reachability to DHCP server residing in different VRF. This approach is not preferred/recommended due to overhead of adding leaked routes in each of the client VRFs and server VRF.

#### 3.1.5.1 Virtual Subnet Selection Sub-option 

DHCP relay supports multiple clients on different VRFs, and these clients can also share the same/overlapping IP addresses. In such VRF deployments, there is a need for the DHCP server to know the client's VRF, so that the address allocation can be done based on that VRF. To convey VRF information, DHCP relay includes the sub-option 151 (for DHCPv4) and sub-option 68 (for DHCPv6) as defined in RFC 6607.

The Virtual subnet selection sub-option (type 0) carries the ASCII VRFNAME configured on the incoming interface to which the client is connected. If the incoming interface is in default VRF, the sub option is not added to the relayed packet. The format of the sub-option added by the relay agent is shown below - only type 0 identifier is supported. This option is supported for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients.

```
 Suboption      Length     Type      Value
    151           7         0        ASCII VPN identifier (VRFNAME)
```

 For DHCPv4, the sub-option 152 is a control sub-option that is added along with 151, to check if the DHCP server supports these sub-options. If the DHCP server strips out sub-option 152 when sending the response to the relay, it indicates that the DHCP server has used the VRFNAME to allocate IP address. If the DHCP server returns sub-option 152 back, it indicates the DHCP server did not understand the sub-options sent by the relay.

 To ensure interoperability, the VSS sub-option must be enabled only when DHCP server supports address allocation based on VRF. Some server may not recognize sub-option and would still allocate lease in global/default VRF space. DHCP relay does not discard those replies from server.

### 3.1.6 Relay and VTEP

DHCP relay can be configured in VXLAN BGP EVPN deployments to provide DHCP service to EVPN clients (VMs). Below diagram shows a typical deployment in VXLAN networks. Note that the client and server can be in same or different VRF domains.

&nbsp;
![Figure7](./dhcp_relay_vxlan.png "Figure7: DHCP Relay over VXLAN")
&nbsp;
__Figure7: DHCP Relay with VXLAN overlay__


* DHCP client is attached to VTEP1 on VLAN 10, which is bound to VrfRed.
* DHCP relay is enabled on VTEP1 for VLAN 10.
* DHCP server is on VTEP2 and is connected to VLAN 20, which is bound to VrfRed.
* VTEP1 has BGP EVPN type-5 route to DHCP server 172.16.0.1 that points to VXLAN tunnel nexthop.
* DHCP relay forwards the incoming packet to 172.16.0.1 with `giaddr` set to 192.168.0.1. Note that relay is unaware of the VxLAN tunnels.
* VTEP1 adds underlay L2/Tunnel headers and forwards the packet to destination VTEP2.
* VTEP2 removes the underlay L2 and tunnel headers, and forwards the DHCP packet to server.
* DHCP server responds to `giaddr` 192.168.0.1. VTEP2 has BGP EVPN type-5 route to relay agent IP address 192.168.0.1 that points to tunnel nexthop.  
* VTEP2 adds underlay L2/tunnel headers and sends the response packet to VTEP1.
* DHCP relay agent on VTEP1 receives the response from server, removes option 82, and forwards the packet to client on VLAN 10.

Note that DHCP relay in BGP EVPN deployments is applicable to L3 VNI configurations. For L2 VNI configurations, there is no need of DHCP relay, as the client and server are directly reachable over extended VLAN.  

Please refer to EVPN-VXLAN HLD for more details.

### 3.1.7 Relay and SAG

Static Anycast Gateway (SAG) allows multiple switches to simultaneously route packets using a common gateway address in an active-active router configuration. Each switch is configured with the same set of virtual IP address and a virtual MAC address.

DHCP relay requires an IP address to identify the subnet of downstream/client-facing interface. If the client interface is enabled for SAG, the DHCP relay uses the SAG IPv4 address as the `giaddr`. If the associated SAG interface does not have any IP address assigned, the relay discards the packet.  Since identical SAG IP address is configured on Leaf switches, the response from server may land on a different leaf switch, and may not reach the leaf switch that relayed the DHCP packet. To avoid this, it is recommended to use link-selection option with source interface.

&nbsp;
![Figure8](./dhcp_relay_sag.png "Figure8: DHCP Relay with SAG")
&nbsp;

__Figure8: DHCP Relay with SAG configuration__


```
# Configure a virtual MAC address for SAG
config ip anycast-mac-address add  00:00:00:00:00:01

# Configure SAG IPv4 address on the VLAN
# The SAG IPv4 address must be reachable from DHCP server
config interface ip anycast-address add Vlan10 192.168.0.1/24

# show ip static-anycast-gateway 
Configured Anycast Gateway MAC address: 00:00:00:00:00:01
IPv4 Anycast Gateway MAC address: enable
Total number of gateway: 1
Total number of gateway admin UP: 1
Total number of gateway oper UP: 1
Interfaces    Gateway Address    Master    Admin/Oper
------------  -----------------  --------  ------------
Vlan10        192.168.0.1/24                  up/up

# Configure IPv4 address on the Loopback interface
config interface ip add Loopback1 55.55.55.55/32

# Enable DHCP relay on the VLAN interface
# Enable link-selection and use Loopback1 as source interface
# Since Vlan10 has SAG IP configured, the `giaddr` is set to 55.55.55.55
config interface ip dhcp-relay add Vlan10 172.0.0.1 -src-intf=Loopback1 -link-select=enable
```

In the above sample configuration for Leaf switch, the SAG gateway '192.168.0.1' is configured on VLAN10. The DHCP relay is enabled on VLAN10. For relaying packet to DHCP server, the 'giaddr' is set to the SAG IP '55.55.55.55'. The DHCP server uses link-selection sub-option 5 to identify the client subnet to be leased. The response from DHCP server is sent to the Loopback IP which is unique to the originating leaf switch.

### 3.1.8 COPP and Rate limiting

The switch default forwarding behavior for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 packets is to trap them to CPU. This is irrespective of whether DHCP relay is enabled. As part of switch initialization, the COPP rules are installed by SWSS. These COPP rules are part of SWSS docker and contain traps for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 packets. There are 2 versions of DHCPv4/v6 COPP rules. (1) L2 version (2) L3 version. The DHCP relay application relies on the L3 version of the DHCP COPP trap, which matches DHCP packets received on L3 interfaces. The L2 version of the trap is intended for applications like ZTP and DHCP snooping. 

The 'show copp config' command can be used to check the COS queue assignment for DHCP packets and associated rate limiting. Packets exceeding the rate limit are dropped. Please refer to SONIC Control Plane Policing HLD for more details.

```
Below is the sample output of the 'show copp config' command displaying the DHCP trap actions and rate limting parameters.

root@sonic:/home/admin# show copp config
{
  "COPP_TABLE:trap.group.dhcp.icmp": {
    "value": {
      "cbs": "5000",
      "cir": "5000",

      "mode": "sr_tcm",
      "queue": "9",
      "red_action": "drop",
      "trap_action": "trap",
      "trap_ids": "dhcp,dhcpv6,icmp,icmpv6",
      "trap_priority": "3"
    }
  }

/* To install L2 DHCP rules using KLISH CLI */
sonic# configure terminal
sonic(config)# policy-map copp-system-policy type copp
sonic(config-policy-map)# class copp-system-dhcpl2
sonic(config-policy-map-flow)# set copp-action copp-system-dhcp

/* To remove DHCP L2 COPP rule using KLISH CLI */
sonic# configure terminal
sonic(config)# policy-map copp-system-policy type copp
sonic(config-policy-map)# no class copp-system-dhcpl2
```

### 3.1.9 IPv4 unnumbered support

For point-to-point links, IPv4 unnumbered configuration enables L3 processing without assigning an explicit IPv4 address. The unnumbered interface borrows the IPv4 address of a "donor" interface that is already configured on the router. This approach saves network address space and simplifies the switch configuration. For more details on IPv4 unnumbered support and limitations, refer to HLD (L3/IPv4_Unnumbered/IPv4_Unnumbered_Interface.md).

DHCP relay supports forwarding packets to server via an IPv4 Unnumbered interface with following limitations:

* Only loopback interfaces are supported as donor interfaces
* IPv4 unnumbered configuration is supported only on Ethernet and Portchannel interfaces.
* IPv4 unnumbered configuration is supported only default VRF.

Note that both ends of the link must be configured as unnumbered interfaces. Also note that the client facing dowstream interface MUST have an IPv4 address associated, it cannot be an IPv4 unnumbered interface, as the server needs to know the client subnet to assign the lease.


![Figure9](./dhcp_ipv4_unnumbered.png "Figure9: DHCP Relay - IPv4 unnumbered")

__Figure9: DHCP Relay with IPv4 unnumbered__

In the above setup, IPv4 unnumbered is configured on Ethernet4 interface, which is a point-to-point link between relay and server. OSPFv2 is enabled on relay switch and server switch, and the loopback network addresses are advertised. The client subnet is also advertised via OSPFv2, so that the server can reply back to the relay switch. The 'giaddr' in the relayed packet is set to '192.168.0.1'. The source IPv4 address in the relayed packet is determined by the routing stack. 

Link-selection can also be enabled in IPv4 unnumbered scenario - if the client subnet is not reachable from server. In that case, the 'giaddr' is set to the Loopback1 address '103.103.103.103'.

```
# Sample relay switch configuration

# Configure IPv4 address on downstream client interface
config interface ip add Ethernet0 192.168.0.1/24

# Configure loopback interface and assign IPv4 address
config loopback add Loopback1
config interface ip add Loopback1 103.103.103.103/32

# Configure IPv4 unnumbered on upstream server interface
config interface ip unnumbered add Ethernet4 Loopback1

# Enable DHCP relay on client interface
config interface ip dhcp-relay add Ethernet0 55.55.55.55

# FRR OSPF configuration on relay switch
# Enable point-to-point OSPF on upstream interface
# Advertise the loopback and client subnet
# Similar configuration needed on server switch

```

### 3.1.10 Handling DHCPv4 packets with relay agent options

To support different network configurations, like cascading relays for example, the relay agent provides 3 different options to handle incoming DHCPv4 packets that already have relay agent options. 

* `discard` - relay agent discards the incoming packet. This is the default behavior. 
* `append` - relay agent appends its own set of relay options to the packet, leaving the incoming options intact. If the length of relay agent information exceeds the max limit of 255 bytes, the packet is discarded.
* `replace` - relay agent removes the incoming options and adds its own set of options to the packet.

### 3.1.11 Server Identifier override sub-option

DHCPv4 relay supports server identifier override sub-option 11 as defined in RFC5107. This sub-option enables relay to act as the DHCPv4 server such that unicast DHCPv4 packets come to the relay agent instead of directly going to server. This enables relay to add appropriate sub-options on the unicast packets too (like RENEW). The server identifier override sub-option is automatically added when link-select sub-option or VSS sub-option is enabled. 

If the DHCPv4 server does not support the server identifier sub-option, then the unicast DHCPv4 packets from client are sent directly to server bypassing the relay agent.

This sub-option is only applicable to DHCPv4 relay agent.

### 3.1.12 Subinterfaces 

DHCPv4/DHCPv6 relay is supported on subinterfaces. Both the DHCP clients (downstream interface) and DHCP servers (upstream interface) can be reachable/attached via subinterfaces. DHCP config manager is enhanced to handle the subinterface naming format. For DHCPv4, the Option 82 Circuit-Id and Remote-Id values in the relayed packet are derived based on the subinterface name associated with the downstream interface. The maximum number of subinterfaces that can be enabled for DHCP relay is limited - refer to the scaling requirements section.

```
# Sample commands to configure DHCP relay on subinterfaces

# Create L3 subinterface on Ethernet28 with VLAN 200
config subinterface add Ethernet28.200 200

# Configure IP address on the subinterface
config interface ip add Ethernet28.200 3.0.0.1/24
config interface ip add Ethernet28.200 1000::1/64

# Enable DHCP relay on the subinterface
config interface ip dhcp-relay add Ethernet28.200 2.0.0.2
config interface ipv6 dhcp-relay add Ethernet28.200 2000::2

# Check the show command to verify the relay is configured
show ip dhcp-relay brief
+------------------+-----------------------+
| Interface Name   | DHCP Helper Address   |
+==================+=======================+
| Ethernet28.200   | 2.0.0.2               |
+------------------+-----------------------+

```

### 3.1.13 Option 82 Circuit-Id format

By default, the DHCP Relay agent encodes Option 82 Circuit-Id suboption based on the interface name on which the DHCP client packet is received. The Circuit-Id is used to relay the DHCP server response packet back to the right client interface. DHCP server may use the Circuit-ID for assigning IP and other parameters.

The following format types are supported for Circuit-Id:

* `%p` - name of the interface on which request was received, for example: Vlan100. 
* `%h:%p` - hostname of the switch followed by interface name.

The default format type is `%p`. The format types can be configured per-client interface. 

```
# DHCP Option 82 - circuit id format examples

Agent-Information Option 82, length 28: 
  Circuit-ID SubOption 1, length 7: "Vlan100"
  Remote-ID SubOption 2, length 17: 52:54:00:c1:65:6b

Agent-Information Option 82, length 43: 
  Circuit-ID SubOption 1, length 22: "sonic-acc-sw-01:Vlan100"
  Remote-ID SubOption 2, length 17: 52:54:00:c1:65:6b
```

## 3.2 DB Changes

### 3.6.3 REST API Support
The REST SET and GET APIs supported by DHCP relay are listed below.  The REST APIs are generated based on the OpenConfig YANG model [relay-agent.yang](https://github.com/openconfig/public/blob/master/release/models/relay-agent/openconfig-relay-agent.yang).

```
# Please refer to CURL [man page](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html)  for more details on the command line options:

 -X option specifies the request method
 -H option specifies extra header to include when sending HTTP request
 -d option sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server

# For authorization, additional headers may be needed. For example: -H "authorization: Basic <encrypted credentials>"

# For DHCPv6 REST APIs, replace 'dhcp' with 'dhcpv6' in the command.
```

Get DHCP relay address on the given interface:
```
# curl -X GET "https://<switch_ip>/restconf/data/openconfig-relay-agent:relay-agent/dhcp/interfaces/interface=Ethernet0/config/helper-address" -H "accept: application/yang-data+json"

>>> {"openconfig-relay-agent:helper-address":["111.0.0.2"]}
```

Add DHCP relay address on the given interface:
```
# curl -X PUT "https://<switch_ip>/restconf/data/openconfig-relay-agent:relay-agent/dhcp/interfaces/interface=Ethernet0/config/helper-address" -H "accept: application/yang-data+json" -H "Content-Type: application/yang-data+json" -d "{ \"openconfig-relay-agent:helper-address\": [ \"9.9.9.9\" ]}"
```

Delete all DHCP relay addresses on the given interface:
```
# curl -X DELETE "https://<switch_ip>/restconf/data/openconfig-relay-agent:relay-agent/dhcp/interfaces/interface=Ethernet0/config/helper-address" -H "accept: application/yang-data+json"
```

Get DHCP relay statistics on the given interface:
```
# curl -X GET "https://<switch_ip>/restconf/data/openconfig-relay-agent:relay-agent/dhcpv6/interfaces/interface=Ethernet0/state/counters" -H "accept: application/yang-data+json"
```

For list of all REST APIS, go to "https://<switch_ip>/ui". The webserver provides information about all the REST URLs, REST Data, return codes and interactive support to execute REST queries.

The following REST APIs are not supported.  For the detailed list of deviations and unsupported objects, refer to extensions YANG model for DHCP relay. 

  * Enabling/Disabling relay agent globally for all interfaces
  * Configuration of Circuit ID and Remote ID

# 6 Serviceability and Debug
SWSS log level utility can be used to enable debug traces in the DHCP relay manager daemon. 

To change log level to INFO:
```
# swssloglevel -l INFO -c dhcprelaymgrd
```

To display current log level setting for components:
```
# swssloglevel -p
```

# 7 Warm Boot Support
Not applicable for this feature.

# 8 Scalability
Up to 4 DHCP relay addresses can be configured on each L3 interface in the system. All L3 interfaces can be enabled for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 relay operation. The maximum number of L3 interface supported is up to 4K.

30. With IPv4 unnumbered configuration, verify the relay forwards client requests after save/reload, config reload operations.
31. Configure IPv4/IPv6 DHCP relay with server and client residing in different VRFs. Ensure client gets the DHCP lease.
32. Enable VSS option, and ensure the relay is appending client VRF name in the relayed packet to server.
33. Verify that adding/modifying/deleting of DHCP server address on the interface does not restart the docker. Check 'uptime' of the docker using 'docker ps' command.
34. Verify that the packets with agent option 82 are handled as per the configured policy action (discard/append/replace).
35. Verify DHCPv4/DHCPv6 relay functionality on L3 subinterfaces (Ethernet and PortChannel based).
36. Verify enabling DHCPv4/DHCPv6 relay functionality on 4K L3 interfaces. 
37. Verify DHCPv4/DHCPv6 statistics on 4K L3 interfaces.
