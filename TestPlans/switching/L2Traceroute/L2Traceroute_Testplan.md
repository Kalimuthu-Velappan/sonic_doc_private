## Introduction

### Feature Overview

L2 Traceroute can trace all the L2 traffic paths for a given VLAN or to a particular destination device in the given VLAN. The destination device is identified based on its IP, DNS name or MAC. The main use of the Trace-L2 feature is to provide flexibility to administrators to determine the L2 paths in a L2 topology.

L2 Traceroute is a proprietary feature and it cannot interop with any other vendors. FYI, cisco has its own proprietary L2-traceroute.



## 1 Test Focus Areas

### 1.1 Functional Requirements

L2 Traceroute feature supports the following:
- Traces all the available paths to a particular IP, MAC or hostname in a VLAN.
- Probes the entire Layer 2 topology.
- Displays the input or output ports of each hop in the path.
- Displays the round trip travel time of each hop.
- Displays hops in a VLAN that form a loop.
- Displays each hop's Layer 2 protocol such as STP, RSTP, 802.1w, SSTP or route-only.

 The resulting trace displays a report that provides information about a packetâ€™s path to a device, such as hop and port information and travel time. It also can locate any Layer 2 loop in a VLAN. The probed Layer 2 information is discarded when a new command is issued again.For each hop in the path, L2 Traceroute displays its input/output port, L2 protocols of the input port, and the microsecond travel time between hop and hop. It also prints out the hops which form a loop, if any. Displaying L2 topology lets a user easily obtain information of all hops.

The devices that will participate in the L2 Traceroute protocol must be assigned to a VLAN and all devices on that VLAN must be SONiC devices that support the L2 Traceroute protocol. Devices that do not support the trace-l2 protocol will forward the L2 Traceroute packets without a reply. Hence, these devices are transparent to the L2 Traceroute protocol. The destination for the packet with the L2 Traceroute protocol must be a device that supports the L2 Traceroute protocol and the destination cannot be a client, such as a personal computer, or devices from other vendors.

L2 Traceroute will follow the xSTP path if enabled in the system
