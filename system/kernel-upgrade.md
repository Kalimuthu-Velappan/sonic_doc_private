## About this Manual

This document describes the steps needed to peform an upgrade of the kernel in SONiC base Debian O/S. The intended public is SONiC engineer who needs to upgrade the kernel used in SONiC.

## Scope

Upgrading the kernel used in SONiC involves different steps which are explained in this document. This document explains how to upgrade the kernel and also identifies potential issues that may occur due to this upgrade. It should be noted that the upgrade process involves several steps which need to be performed in sequence.

## Introduction

SONiC is based on the Debian Kernel. The Debian kernel is in turn based on upstream linux kernel, with numerous Debian specific patches.

When the current kernel information is queried on a SONiC switch, below information is seen:
```
root@sonic:/home/admin# uname -a
Linux sonic 4.9.0-9-2-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.168-1+deb9u3 (2015-12-19) x86_64 GNU/Linux
root@sonic:/home/admin# dpkg -l | grep linux-image-
ii  linux-image-4.9.0-9-2-amd64        4.9.168-1+deb9u3                   amd64        Linux 4.9 for 64-bit PCs
```
 - **“1+deb9u3”** is the version of the [linux-latest source](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/linux-4.9) package
 - **"4.9.0-9-2"** is the ABI version of the kernel. It appears in specific kernels’ package names, e.g. [linux-image-4.9.0-9-2-amd64](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/linux-image-4.9.0-9-2-amd64). The ABI version represents the base number of the kernel series and a number which is bumped every time the kernel ABI changes in an incompatible way. This [document](https://kernel-team.pages.debian.net/kernel-handbook/ch-versions.html) provides more details about the kernel ABI.
 - **"4.9.168-1"** is the package version of the kernel. **"4.9.168"** is the upstream kernel version, which can get downloaded from this [link](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/). **"9-2"** is the version of the packaging. The first package of a given upstream version is normally given version 1 of the packaging, then every time a new package is uploaded (without changing the corresponding upstream), the packaging version is incremented. More details of what has changed in each version can be obtained from the [Debian-specific changelog](https://tracker.debian.org/media/packages/l/linux/changelog-4.9.168-1).

In this document, the use case of upgrading the kernel from **4.9.0-9-2 (4.9.168-1+deb9u3)** to **4.9.0-11 (4.9.189-3+deb9u2)** has been discussed. After the kernel upgrade, the output of uname -a command will look like below:
```
root@sonic:/home/admin# uname -a
Linux sonic 4.9.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.189-3+deb9u2 (2019-11-11) x86_64 GNU/Linux
root@sonic:/home/admin# dpkg -l | grep linux-image-

```
 - **“3+deb9u2”** is the version of the [linux-latest source](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/linux-4.9) package
 - **"4.9.0-11"** is the ABI version of the kernel. It appears in specific kernels’ package names, e.g. [linux-image-4.9.0-11-amd64](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/linux-image-4.9.0-11-amd64).
 - **"4.9.189-3"** is the package version of the kernel. **"4.9.189"** is the upstream kernel version, which can be downloaded from [here](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/). **"3"** is the version of the packaging. Details of what changed in each version is listed in the [Debian-specific changelog](https://tracker.debian.org/media/packages/l/linux/changelog-4.9.189-3).

## Kernel upgrade procedure

### High Level Description

Following SONiC repositories/sub-modules need to be updated as part of kernel upgrade:
 - sonic-linux-kernel
 - sonic-buildimage
 - various sub-modules under platform the directory

Below are the steps involved in the kernel upgrade process:
 1. Build the new kernel Debian packages in sonic-linux-kernel
 2. Replace all references to previous kernel with newer kernel in all other modules.

The 1st step may involve a lot of code changes based on the difference between various pre-existing SONiC added kernel patches and the target kernel version.

### Build the new kernel Debian packages in sonic-linux-kernel

#### Introduction

You will need to modify the rules/config file to allow an incremental build of the kernel:
```
DEFAULT_KERNEL_PROCURE_METHOD = incremental
```

The Debian kernel is packaged within three Debian packages:
 - linux-headers-4.9.0-9-2-common-rt_4.9.168-1+deb9u3_all.deb
 - linux-image-4.9.0-9-2-amd64-dbg_4.9.168-1+deb9u3_amd64.deb
 - linux-support-4.9.0-9-2_4.9.168-1+deb9u3_all.deb

The first import changes are to update the SONiC related kernel patches in sonic-linux-kernel/patch directory. Depending of the difference between the two kernel versions, these changes can be minimal or may require a lot of attention. Typically, if the kernel upgrade is from version w.x.y to w.x.z, that is changing only the minor revision number, most of the existing SONiC kernel patches should apply without any trouble. But when changing the major revision number (e.g 4.9 to 4.19) it is more likely that **much** more work will be needed.

Instead of building the kernel by running the command "bb make target/debs/stretch/linux-headers-4.9.0-11-common_4.9.189-3+deb9u2_all.deb", it will be more productive to login into the build container and build manually the kernel using following the commands from the Makefile. This will allow the developer to make changes incrementally, as needed.

#### Step #1: Update Makefile

In this first step, the kernel names and version are modified in the main sonic-linux-kernel/Makefile:

```

diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile

 ifneq ($(wildcard $(BUILD_DIR)),)
 ifeq ($(kernel_procure_method), incremental)
```

Since the new kernel is not -yet- hosted on the SONiC azure server, it needs to be  fetched from the Debian host servers.

#### Step #2: update preconfig patches

The patches in the patch/preconfig directory are applied **before** the SONiC kernel patches are applied. In current  example, below are the patches applied:
```
bash-4.1$ cat patch/preconfig/series
changelog.patch
packaging-update-abiname-to-9-2.patch
kernel-preconfig-optimize.patch
```

When there is a change in the ABI version it is likely that the changelog.patch needs to be updated at the minimum.
In current example, below changes are made:

```
diff --git a/patch/preconfig/changelog.patch b/patch/preconfig/changelog.patch

Once the kernel has been built, Debian build procedeure checks for the kernel ABI. This is done by running the script *debian/bin/buildcheck.py*

It has been observed that this script is not able to validate that the ABI matches and is bailing out with an error.  Below is the patch in the script to allow it to always succeed by skipping all the ABI check test. This patch will be removed after further investigation:
```
bash-4.1$ cat kernel-buildcheck.py.patch
Allow the kernel ABI checking to not fail with and ABI set to 11
instead of 4.9.0-11

#### Step #3: Build the kernel manually

As mentioned before, the most effective approach to build the new kernel is to go inside the build container and type each command from the Makefile, starting from the command "dpkg-source -$(DSC_FILE)"
```
bb -m sonic-lvn-csg-004 BLDENV=stretch make sonic-slave-bash
cd src/sonic-linux-kernel
dpkg-source -x linux_4.9.189-3+deb9u2.dsc
pushd linux_4.9.189
etc.
```
In current example, the "sonic-lvn-csg-004" build server is being used. Change it as per the need.

Building the kernel step by step will give instant feedback to the developer if somethings goes wrong.

The build procedure should be able to go up to the point where the kernel patches are applied, *"stg import -s ../patch/series"*. Stop here **before** running this command, since there can be work to do before the patches can be applied to the new kernel.

#### Step #4: Update the SONiC kernel patches

The best approach to see which patches can be applied successfully or not, is to use below script:
```
 #!/bin/bash

pushd linux-4.9.189

cnt=0
while read p; do
    if [ ${p:0:1} != "#" ]; then
        cnt=$((cnt+1))
        grep "$p" ../patch/success > /dev/null
        if [ ! $? = 0 ]; then
            r=$(patch -s -t -p1 --dry-run < ../patch/$p | wc -l)
            if [ "$r" = "0" ]; then
                patch -p1 < ../patch/$p
                echo $p >> ../patch/success
            else
                echo "*** Patch \"$p\" failed"
                echo $p >> ../patch/fail
            fi
        fi
    fi
done <../patch/series

popd
```

The file *patch/success* contains the list of all patches which were successfully applied to the new kernel.

The file *patch/fail* contains the list of all patches which failed to apply and thus were  **not** applied to the new kernel.

Each failing patch needs to be addressed individually.

### Kernel version references in SONiC source code

Search for all instances of current kernel version at the top level SONiC source code directory. Run this command after issuing the *make init* command so that all submodules are also searched:
```
bash-4.1$ git --no-pager grep -l "4\.9\.0-9-2"
build_debian.sh
files/build_templates/swss.service.j2
files/build_templates/syncd.service.j2
installer/x86_64/install.sh
platform/barefoot/bfn-modules/debian/control
platform/barefoot/sonic-platform-modules-bfn-montara/debian/control
platform/barefoot/sonic-platform-modules-bfn/debian/control
platform/broadcom/sai-modules.mk
platform/broadcom/saibcm-modules/debian/control
platform/broadcom/saibcm-modules/debian/opennsl-modules.dirs

platform/broadcom/sonic-platform-modules-delta/debian/platform-modules-et-6248brb.init
platform/broadcom/sonic-platform-modules-delta/et-6248brb/scripts/led_status.sh
platform/broadcom/sonic-platform-modules-inventec/debian/control
platform/broadcom/sonic-platform-modules-s6000/debian/control
platform/centec/sonic-platform-modules-e582/debian/control
platform/nephos/nephos-modules/debian/control
platform/nephos/nephos-modules/modules/init.d/nps-modules-4.9.0-8-2-amd64
platform/nephos/nephos-modules/modules/service/nps-modules-4.9.0-8-2-amd64.service
platform/nephos/sonic-platform-modules-accton/debian/control
rules/linux-kernel.mk
slave.mk
```

Use below command to search and replace the kernel names:
```
git --no-pager grep -l "4\.9\.0-9-2" | xargs sed -i -e "s/4\.9\.0-9-2/4\.9\.0-11/g
```

Use below command to search for the upstream kernel version:
```
bash-4.1$ git --no-pager grep -l "4\.9\.168"                                   
rules/linux-kernel.mk
slave.mk
```
Search and replace "4.9.168" with "4.9.189"

Search for the string "1+deb9u3":
```
bash-4.1$ git --no-pager grep -l "1+deb9u3"
rules/linux-kernel.mk
slave.mk
```
Search and replace "1+deb9u3" with "3+deb9u2"

There are few  submodules which reference the kernel version:
```
git submodule foreach --recursive '[ -f .git ] && git grep -l "4\.9\.0-9-2"'
```

Change the kernel name in each file which contains the reference to "4.9.0-9-2".

### Building the kernel Debian packages

Before building a SONiC image, first attempt to build the kernel since all the changes to build it successfully were performed within the build container. It is a good practice to verify that the target for our new kernel exists:
```
bash-4.1$ bb make list | grep "linux-headers"<<Waiting for dispatch ...>>
<<Starting on sonic-lvn-csg-002>>
target/debs/stretch/linux-headers-4.9.0-11-common_4.9.189-3+deb9u2_all.deb
target/debs/stretch/linux-headers-4.9.0-11-amd64_4.9.189-3+deb9u2_amd64.deb
bash-4.1$
```

Before building the linux kernel, following build directory needs to be deleted:
```
mv src/sonic-linux-kernel/linux-4.9.189 /projects/csg_sonic/.fast-remove/
```

Finally, build the Debian kernel archives:
```
bb make target/debs/stretch/linux-headers-4.9.0-11-common_4.9.189-3+deb9u2_all.deb
```

### Building the SONiC image

After the new kernel debian packages are ready, the next step is to build the SONiC installer image:
```
bb make target/sonic-broadcom.bin
```



## Verification

Load the new image on the switch. Verify that the new kernel is now running. Also check dmesg for any errors:
```
root@sonic:/home/admin# uname -a
Linux sonic 4.9.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.189-3+deb9u2 (2019-11-11) x86_64 GNU/Linux
root@sonic:/home/admin#
```
